# If you’re looking for a new career or job as a Python developer, then all these lessons would be for naught if you
# can’t pass the interview process. For this Friday, we’re going to cover the process of a general software
# development interview. We’ll cover each stage, what to do before and after the interview, whiteboarding,
# answering general and technical questions, and how to contour your resumes and profiles. This lesson is meant to be
# helpful for those either struggling on the interview process or those of you who have never had a formal software
# development interview. If you have no interest in this section, and wish to continue, use today as a break from
# this book’s schedule. Developer Interview Process The interview process for a developer role can be broken down
# into many different stages. In the following, you’ll find the main stages that many companies in the industry
# practice. Keep in mind that this is a general interview process and not every company will follow these to a tee.
# Use this section as more of a guide on what to possibly expect: • Stage 1 – Basic questions about yourself along
# with past work experience. The first step will usually be a phone call with a 3rd party recruiter,
# internal recruiter, HR, or talent acquisition of the company. During the first step of the interview process,
# the interviewer is trying to gauge if you are the correct fit for the role. They are looking for you to mention the
# “Buzzwords” along with providing information on why you are a good fit for the position. You want to relate
# yourself to the position. Be sure to talk about your experience using the languages and technologies they’re
# looking for. The interviewer is looking for you to meet half of the requirements to make yourself a good match. No
# one will ever know everything, but it is good to show them what you know and your willingness to learn.


# Note Buzzwords are keywords that the position is looking for. For example, a
# back-end position using Python would expect to hear words like API, JSON, Python,
# Flask, Django, Jinja, Relational Databases, PostgreSQL, etc.


# Stage 2 – If you’ve made it past the phone screen, you’ll usually be asked to come in for an in-person interview.
# This stage is generally where you meet other developers that currently work at the company. Although they’ll ask
# you interview questions, this stage is generally for the employees to see if they would like to work with you and
# get to know you on a more personal level. Generally, you’ll interview with small groups of employees at a time.
# You’ll have about two to five of these sessions that will last around 10–15 minutes each. Before hiring an
# individual, these groups will generally get together to discuss potential candidates for the next stage. During
# this stage, be sure to properly introduce yourself and shake each person’s hand. Get to know each employee,
# and try to relate with them on a personal level.


# Stage 3 – This is the technical round. In this stage, questions will be asked
# to assess the developer’s skills and abilities. Generally, there will
# be a whiteboard question, a couple technical questions on
# paper, and a brain teaser. This stage is generally conducted with
# the hiring manager, or team manager that you’ll be working with.
# When asked a question, make sure you understand it clearly. You
# are more than welcome to ask as many questions as you need to
# clearly understand the problem before answering the question. If
# you do not know the answer to the question, let the interviewer
# know that you have not worked with that concept or do not see
# the problem. The interviewer during this stage will know if you
# have no idea what you’re talking about so don’t try and make
# something up. They’ll be more impressed with your honesty and
# try to guide you through the problem. During this stage, they
# don’t care if you’re right or wrong. They’re more interested in how
# you think and how well you can problem-solve.


# Stage 4
# – At this point, you’re generally sitting with the hiring manager or
# an HR personnel. In this stage, you can ask questions about the
# company, as well as the job role. If you’ve made it this far, the
# company has seen value in you as a potential employee. Usually,
# this is where contract negotiations and salary conversations
# occur. At the end of the interview, always have questions ready to
# ask and lots of them. If you have no questions, it’s generally a sign
# of not being prepared or laziness.


# What to Do Before the Interview
# In almost everything that you do in life, you can never be too prepared. The same goes
# for interviewing. The following are tips for what you should do before your interview:
# • Research
# – Be sure to research the company you’re interviewing for. Don’t
# just understand what products they create, or services they offer,
# but know what charities they support, the companies they partner
# with, etc. It shows that you’re involved and care about the companies’ well-being. A little goes a long way.
# • Be Prepared
# – Put together a folder or portfolio of that includes your resume, a
# pad of paper for taking notes during the interview, examples of
# work, etc.


# Resume
# – Always print on resume on higher quality paper.
# – Contour your resume to the job you’re interviewing for. For
# example, for back-end roles, mention Python, SQL, database�related technologies, etc.
# – Keep your resume to a single page.
# – Don’t add any fluff.
# – Keep it organized with sections like experience, skills, and
# education.
# – Think of your resume as a 30-second elevator pitch.
# – Often, it helps to have a designer overlook your resume. Some
# sites will do this for a small fee but help to make your resume look
# more professional and organized.


# Portfolio Web Site – Not all developers have personal web sites, but it certainly looks bad when you don’t. Imagine
# going to a dentist that has no teeth. View yourself as the product that you’re trying to sell to companies,
# you should have a web site that shows your skills and allows others to contact you.


# Github
# – Almost every hiring agency and company will look to your Github
# to see the projects you’ve worked on.
# – It’s best to have complete projects on your portfolio as well. One
# major project will always stand out better than 10 minor projects.
# – Include your Github account in your resume, portfolio web site,
# and e-mails.


# LinkedIn
# – Most recruiters and companies are on LinkedIn for one reason,
# and that’s to look for potential candidates for a job posting.
# Make sure your profile is up to date with all relative information
# and projects that you’ve worked on.
# – Your profile picture should be professional. You don’t need to be
# in a suit and tie, but it’s best not to have a picture of you on a
# beach.
# – Look at this web site as your professional networking service.
# – Post often with information from the field you want to work in.
# The more you post, the more apt a recruiter is to recognize you.


# Social Media
# – Make it private or keep it clean. You better believe companies will
# look at your posts for a way to understand who you are, and if they
# don’t like what they see, you won’t be getting a call back.


# Apply Directly – It always looks more professional to send in an application directly to the company. Often,
# you’ll find a job you like on Indeed or ZipRecruiter; however, these companies get flooded with applications every
# day on these sites, and they generally have algorithms to eliminate most candidates. Sending a direct e-mail shows
# that you put time and effort into directly contacting the company.


# General Questions
# The following is a list of general nontechnical questions, followed by an example of
# a good answer. These questions were selected because they are usually asked and
# answered improperly:
# • What salary are you looking for?
# – “I don’t have an exact number right now. I’d like to do some more
# research on what other companies are offering for a similar
# position. What do you pay your employees on average for this
# position?”
# – Never state a number when they ask, this provides leverage for
# them during any negotiation process.


# – Counter their question with another question.
# – If they continue to ask you for a number, simply state the same
# response.
# • Where do you see yourself in five years?
# – “I’m more so focused on my skills over the next five years. I know
# that focusing on continuing my education and improvement of
# myself will lead me to where I need to be.”
# – Focusing on improving your skills shows compassion.
# • Why did you want to be a software developer?
# – “I’ve always been intrigued by being able to build something out
# of nothing, and I’ve always enjoyed a challenge. When you’re able
# to solve problems and build applications, it’s a wonderful feeling.”
# – Show the passion that you have as a developer; it will always
# come off as a strength.
# – Never mention it’s about money, even if it is.
# • Why are you changing careers?
# – “It felt like I wasn’t being challenged enough in my previous
# career and I’ve always been interested in programming and the
# thrill that comes with building applications that improve people’s
# lives.”
# – Like the previous question, show the passion and drive that you
# have for this career.
# – Explaining that you like to be challenged shows your not lazy.
# – Never mention it’s about money, even if it is.
# • Why do you want to work here?
# – “The applications that you build here help so many users around
# the world, and I’d love to be a part of that.”
# – Talk about the applications or charities that the company works
# with. It shows that you have passion, work well in teams, and that
# your driven.


# – Mentioning the culture of the company would be a great answer
# as well.
# – Do not mention salary, benefits, or even worse… have no answer.
# • Tell me about a tough software problem and how you solved it.
# – “I was working on a project where I was assigned to implement
# the Steam API into the application. Unfortunately, the API
# wouldn’t connect properly. Using the debugger, I set break
# points at the import and function call locations. After realizing
# that they weren’t being hit at all, I figured it must be an issue
# with connecting. Having tried several import variations, and
# reading through the documentation, I decided to set up the
# application to close when the function was hit. When I ran the
# program the next time, it closed instantly. Realizing that the
# function is being called, but the application isn’t running properly, I figured it had to be an import issue. It wasn’t until I tested
# the API in a more up-to-date application that the problem was
# due to the code being written in version 2.2, when the API
# required version 3.6. In order to connect the API, I had to manually import the library through a mapper function that could
# translate the code between versions. After realizing that the
# mapper worked, I was able to implement the libraries that the
# Steam API included in its SDK.”

# Go as in depth as you can with the problem. They want to
# know every little detail that caused the issue, how you fixed
# the problem, and all the ideas you had in trying to solve the
# problem. Although the preceding answer may not have made
# much sense to you right now, it shows the problem, what I did
# to try and find the issue, as well as how I came up with a solution
# once I found the problem.



# Whiteboarding and Technical Questions
# This section is a list of tips that you should consider using during the third stage of the
# interview process for both whiteboarding and technical questions:
# • Take Your Time
# – There’s absolutely no rush to solve a problem. Think through a
# proper solution first before answering the question. Often, you’ll
# think of two or three different solutions given time.
# • Speak Out Loud
# – Always talk through your thought process. It makes the interviewer
# feel more comfortable so that you’re both not sitting in a quiet
# room while you think.
# – It shows the interviewer your ability to problem-solve.
# – Even if you don’t give the correct answer, they can at least
# understand where you went wrong and offer some guidance.
# • Steps > Syntax
# – When whiteboarding, you’ll need to write out a function or some
# lines of code on the board in front of the interviewer. The most
# important thing to remember is that your thought process is more
# important than your actual code.
# – You can have syntactical bugs on a whiteboard and still pass the
# interview; however, having an incorrect algorithm or set of steps
# will cause you to fail.



# • Ask Questions
# – If you’re unsure, ask questions. It’s perfectly fine to ask questions
# when trying to solve a problem.
# – Keep in mind the questions you ask matter though. There’s a big
# difference in asking what a sort method does, compared to what
# type of sort method would you like me to use.



# • Algorithmic Complexity
# – Always keep in mind the complexity of an algorithm. You’ll
# generally be asked after you write your code if there is a way to
# improve the performance of it even further.
# – Know the Big O Notation category of the algorithm you just wrote.
# – Think about what data types or collections would work best for
# your scenario.
# • Be Honest
# – If you don’t know an answer, absolutely do not try and talk your
# way through it. The interviewer during this stage is a professional
# developer and can pick apart anything that doesn’t make sense.
# – Being honest and saying you’re not sure but are willing to learn
# the material will always prove to be a better method of answering
# questions you don’t know how to solve.




# End of Interview Questions
# You never want to be empty handed at the end of an interview when they ask if you have
# any questions. It’s usually good practice to take notes during an interview and write
# down questions as you think of them. In the following, you’ll find a list of questions that
# you should consider asking:
# • How is the commute?
# • Is parking free?
# • Do you hold social events?
# • If I wanted to further my career skills, do you guys offer any services or
# tuition reimbursement?
# • What kind of benefits do you offer?
# • What is the company culture like?
# • How many people will be working on the team with me?
# • Will there be mentoring involved?
# • Can you tell me more about the day-to-day responsibilities of this role?



# • What do you like best about working for this company?
# • What is the typical career path within this company for someone in
# this role?
# • What are the next steps in the interview process?
# • What might I expect in a typical day?
# • What charities does this company support?
# • Are there any company activities, like sports teams?
# What to Do After the Interview
# Even if you pass the first three stages, you can still fail miserably if you don’t execute the
# proper steps following the interview. In the following, you’ll find examples of what you
# should do once the interview process is complete:



# • Follow Up
# – Always, always, always send an e-mail to the interviewer imme�diately, thanking them for their time. It shows respect and is a
# courteous gesture.
# • Critique Yourself
# – Understand your own mistakes. Don’t take it personal; the only
# way you can get better is by understanding and self-reflecting.
# • Continue Building
# – Always be working on projects and trying to improve your
# portfolio.
# – Stay up to date with the latest libraries, languages, and
# technologies.
# – Update your resume and portfolio often.
# • Adventure Out
# – Go out to local networking events in your area. This is where
# you’ll meet most of your connections. It’s always easier to land a
# job when you know someone who works in the company.
# – Events like code alongs, or hackathons, are a great way to meet
# other developers looking to work together.

# • Rejection
# – It happens, you won’t always get the job. If it does occur, be sure
# to ask the interviewer in a courteous manner as to why you didn’t
# get the job. Don’t take it personally; instead use this information
# to become a better developer and improve.
